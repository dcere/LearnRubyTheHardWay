Exercises from http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/

Exercises 3 to 45 are simple ruby text files.
Exercises 46 to 51 are projects with their own folder.

Extras (if done) are denoted with a hyphen and the extra number after it.
Example: ex5-4.rb contains exercise number 5 with extra number 4.


Notes:

I used ruby 1.8.7 to do the tutorial. Some things might be different
for you if you are using another version.


Disclaimer:

Exercise 51 was done before Zed completed/reviewed the article.
I created the test_gothonweb.rb file by myself so if there is something wrong
please send an e-mail to him so that he can update the solution.
I was doing this tutorial to learn, I am not an expert Ruby programmer.
