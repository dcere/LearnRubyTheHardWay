     This library can be distributed under the terms of the Ruby
     license. You can freely distribute/modify this library.

     It is included in the Ruby standard library.


Description
-----------
     ftools adds several (class, not instance) methods to the File
     class, for copying, moving, deleting, installing, and comparing
     files, as well as creating a directory path. See the File class for
     details.

     FileUtils contains all or nearly all the same functionality and
     more, and is a recommended option over ftools

     When you

       require 'ftools'

     then the File class aquires some utility methods for copying,
     moving, and deleting files, and more.

     See the method descriptions below, and consider using FileUtils as
     it is more comprehensive.
